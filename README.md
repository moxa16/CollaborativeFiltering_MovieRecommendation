# CollaborativeFiltering_MovieRecommendation

- Recommender systems are algorithms designed to help users discover movies, products, and songs by predicting the userâ€™s rating of each     item and displaying similar items that they might rate high as well.

- The objective is to show customers content that they would like best based on their historical activity.
